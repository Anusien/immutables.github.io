Overview
--------

[Immutables](https://immutables.github.io/) team is happy to announce Immutables 2.8.1 release. 

This release comes one month after [2.8.0](https://github.com/immutables/immutables.github.io/blob/src/2.8.0-release.md) and contains 
several improvements, bugfixes and new functionalities.

# Notable changes

### Criteria
- Generate criteria DSL from existing [JavaBeans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaBeans)([spec](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/articles/javaee/spec-136004.html)) classes. Useful for projects which use JavaBeans for legacy reasons or not yet fully migrated to immutables. See [#1103](https://github.com/immutables/immutables/pull/1103)
- Pluggable ID resolution. Introduce [IdResolver](https://github.com/immutables/immutables/blob/master/criteria/common/src/org/immutables/criteria/backend/IdResolver.java) interface to allow users to provide their own annotations (or logic) for ID attribute selection. It complements
default `@Criteria.Id` annotation.
- Initial support for partial updates. Allow partial changes to be applied directly by the backend (if supported).
```java
// example
    repository.update(person.id.is(123))
       .set(person.name, "Changed Name")
       .set(person.age, 33)
       .execute()
```
- Support top-level `count()` operation similar to `COUNT(*)` in SQL
```java
repository.findAll().count();
repository.find(person.age.greaterThan(33)).count();
```

- Add `upsert` / `update` operations on entity in Writable interface

### Mongo jackson adapter
- Support BSON `undefined` type which is converted to java `null` ([9a64881](https://github.com/immutables/immutables/commit/9a64881))
- Support BSON binary data ([76fb7b44](https://github.com/immutables/immutables/commit/76fb7b44))
- Lazily read values from bson stream ([1c07466](https://github.com/immutables/immutables/commit/1c07466)). Potentially a performance improvement since values don't have to be deserialized unless required by deserializer. Allows faster `skipChildren()` calls. 
- Make BsonGenerator null safe on strings and numbers ([ba78d7](https://github.com/immutables/immutables/commit/ba78d7))

### Mongo repositories
Changes related to [mongo repositories](https://immutables.github.io/mongo.html) (predecessor to criteria).

- Enable `_id` initialization in MongoDB ([#1074](https://github.com/immutables/immutables/pull/1074)). PR from [André Rouél](https://github.com/arouel)
- `bson4gson` adapter. Support BSON `undefined` type translated to java `null` 
- `bson4gson` adapter. Friendlier type conversion between BSON temporal types and java numbers (int / long etc.)
- `bson4gson` adapter. Fix `peek()` method in JsonReader ([6f1247](https://github.com/immutables/immutables/commit/6f1247))
- Require Java 8

### Codegen 
- Support [lazy hashing](https://immutables.github.io/immutable.html#lazy-computation-of-hashcode) via `lazyhash` attribute. Contrary to existing [prehash](https://immutables.github.io/immutable.html#lazy-computation-of-hashcode), lazyhash would compute hashcode on first access to `hashCode()` method.
- Changed how `META-INF/annotations/org.immutables.value.immutable` is read - disabled URLConnection caching. [PR-1060](https://github.com/immutables/immutables/issues/1060) from [Canay ÖZEL](https://github.com/canayozel)
- Set optBits for Modifiable, Default maps. [PR-1086](https://github.com/immutables/immutables/pull/1086) from [Dylan Wragge](https://github.com/dwragge)

### Third party library upgrades and other dependencies
- Jackson databind 2.8.11.3 -> 2.8.11.4 ([9ea18](https://github.com/immutables/immutables/commit/9ea18))
- Mongo java (sync) driver 3.10.1 -> 3.11.0 ([33f98d4](https://github.com/immutables/immutables/commit/33f98d4))
- Mongo reactive streams 1.11 -> 1.12 ([fed2e07](https://github.com/immutables/immutables/commit/fed2e07))
- rxjava2 2.2.10 -> 2.2.12 ([c6e06ce](https://github.com/immutables/immutables/commit/c6e06ce))
- ErrorProne 2.3.2 -> 2.3.3 ([b62fab4f](https://github.com/immutables/immutables/commit/b62fab4f))
- Remove `utility` maven module ([1089](https://github.com/immutables/immutables/issues/1089)). All modules will
  declare dependencies explicitly.
