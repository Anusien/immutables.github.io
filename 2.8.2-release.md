Overview
--------
Main feature of this release is `DISTINCT` statement in Criteria. Plus, small functionalities and bugfixes.

# Notable changes

### Criteria
- Support for `DISTINCT` modifier in queries. Simple DSL to allow chaining `DISTINCT / LIMIT / OFFSET` modifiers ([9d639225](https://github.com/immutables/immutables/commit/9d6392258ce5b47b09d7d6b35a5f5b168de3471b))

```java
// example of DISTINCT query
repository.find(person.isActive.isTrue())
     .orderBy(person.name.asc())
     .select(person.name)
     .distinct()
     .limit(2)
     .fetch();
```

### Geode backend
- Escape [reserved words](https://geode.apache.org/docs/guide/19/developing/querying_basics/reserved_words.html) (eg. `type`, `time`) in OQL ([da9b7e1](https://github.com/immutables/immutables/commit/da9b7e1a8052442dd8e0abf0ff1a5a544a8c6b4f))

### Codegen 
- Remove unnecessary empty line between `hashCode()` and `toString()` functions introduced by previous commit

### Gson / JSON Adapters
- Fixed issue where integers are always printed as doubles ([#1120](https://github.com/immutables/immutables/pull/1120)) by Ben Mazzarol (@bmazzarol)
- Fixed issue using the jackson XML streaming parser where boolean tokens are always strings ([#1120](https://github.com/immutables/immutables/pull/1120)) by Ben Mazzarol (@bmazzarol)


### Other changes
- Change dependency scope of `jackson-datatype-guava` and `jackson-datatype-jdk8` to `test` in ElasticSearch backend. They were used only in tests. 
- Enable [errorprone](https://errorprone.info/) static analysis in criteria module ([ef5f1a267](https://github.com/immutables/immutables/commit/ef5f1a2672daca5955ecb2c755a5a975964ae603))
