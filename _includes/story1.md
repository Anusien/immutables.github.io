Immutables could be tailored to your style and coding conventions. Whether accessors should have `get` prefix, or if prefer having `with`, `set` on builders and `Impl` on implementations: create own style annotation and apply it on a classes or whole packages.

_Immutables_ toolkit is so flexible that allows you to create implementations and builders of types from other packages and libraries or even create builders to invoke static methods!
