Immutables uses [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) static website generator for documentation.

Usually one needs to checkout two branches (in different folders):
1. `src` original code in Markdown format
2. `master` static resources generated by Jekyll from `src`

Make sure to symlink `_site` (in `src` branch) to `../immutables-site` (`master` branch). 
When jekyll generates new website it will go into `master` branch.
Once happy with the result (after checking `jekyll serve`) push changes (static resources) to remote `master`.
